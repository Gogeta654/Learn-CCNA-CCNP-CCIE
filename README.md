#  Cisco Networking Study Path

Welcome to my self-structured Cisco networking course covering **CCNA**, **CCNP**, and **CCIE** topics. This repository is a personal knowledge base, built from my own learning, labs, research, and study plans. It is **not based on official Cisco exam content or NDA material** — just what I’ve learned through hands-on experience and open resources.

##  Course Structure

The content is divided into three main sections:

| Level  | Description                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
|  CCNA | Core networking fundamentals & basic configuration |
|  CCNP | Intermediate enterprise networking & services      |
|  CCIE | Expert-level deep-dives & design scenarios         |


Each folder contains:

- Notes
- Lab topologies (Packet Tracer)
- Commands & Config Snippets
- Real-world use cases

##  Why This Exists

I created this repo to:

- Reinforce my understanding of Cisco networking topics
- Track my study progress and lab exercises
- Share clean, modular notes that others might benefit from
- Avoid depending on “exam dumps” or unofficial exam content

>  **Disclaimer:** This material is purely for educational purposes. It is not affiliated with Cisco and does not contain proprietary exam content.
